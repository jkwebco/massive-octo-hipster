It was originally code named \"Majel\" after Majel Barrett, the wife of Gene Roddenberry, and well known as the voice of computer systems in his Star Trek franchise; it was also codenamed \"assistant\".[3]\r\n\r\nOn June 27, 2012, Google Now was unveiled as part of the premier demonstration of Android 4.1 Jelly Bean at the Google I/O.[4]\r\n\r\nOn October 29, 2012, Google Now received an update through the Google Play Store bringing the addition of Gmail cards.[5] Google Now displays cards with information pulled from the user's Gmail account, such as flight information, package tracking information, hotel reservations and restaurant reservations. Other additions were movies, concerts, stocks and news cards based on the users location and search history. Also included is creating calendar events using voice input. On December 5, 2012, an update to the Google Search application brought several new features to Google Now, including cards for: nearby events; searching by camera when at a museum or shop; airplane boarding passes found from e-mail (United Airlines only, more airlines to come); weather at upcoming travel destinations; birthday reminders; and monthly summaries of biking and walking activities. New voice action features included with this update include the ability to post to Google+, song recognition capabilities, and the ability to scan bar codes.[6] However, when the Search 2.5 update hit, Google removed \"Search With Camera\" feature for unknown reasons.\r\n\r\nOn March 21, 2013, the executive Chairman of Google, Eric Schmidt, stated that Google has submitted an iOS version of Google Now to Apple for review and that the app was awaiting approval, but he later clarified that this was not true[7] after Apple denied this was the case. Despite this, on April 29, 2013, Google Now was made available for iOS in an update to the operating system's Google Search application.[8]\r\n\r\nBased on Google Chrome code review logs from December 2012, Google Now was expected to be integrated into the desktop version of Google Chrome.[9] According to Seth Rosenblatt of CNET, it is rumored that Google Now will also serve as iGoogle's replacement in November 2013.[10] On May 15, 2013, at Google I/O 2013, Google announced the upcoming release of Google Now on desktop platforms; the feature will be accessible only via Google Chrome or Google Chrome OS.[11] On January 16th, 2014, an alpha version of the Google Now was made available on desktop through the Google Chrome Canary release although this app lacks some of the cards available on mobile version of Google Now such as public alerts, nearby photos, activity summary and stocks.[1]\r\nFunctionality\r\n\r\nGoogle Now is implemented as an aspect of the Google Search application. It recognizes repeated actions that a user performs on the device (common locations, repeated calendar appointments, search queries, etc.) to display more relevant information to the user in the form of \"cards\". The system leverages Google's Knowledge Graph project, a system used to assemble more detailed search results by analyzing their meaning and connections.[4][12]\r\n\r\nSpecialized cards currently comprise:[13]\r\n\r\n    Activity Summary (Walking and Biking)\r\n    Birthday\r\n    Concerts\r\n    Events\r\n    Flights\r\n    Gmail: Boarding Pass\r\n    Gmail: Events\r\n    Gmail: Flights\r\n    Gmail: Hotels\r\n    Gmail: Packages\r\n    Gmail: Restaurants\r\n    Live TV\r\n    Movies\r\n    New Albums/Books/Video Games/TV Episodes\r\n    News\r\n    Next Appointment\r\n    Places\r\n    Public Alerts\r\n    Public Transit\r\n    Reminders: Time\r\n    Reminders: Location\r\n    Reminders: Event\r\n    Research Topics\r\n    Saved Offers\r\n    Sports\r\n    Stocks\r\n    Traffic\r\n    Travel: Nearby Attractions\r\n    Travel: Nearby Events\r\n    Travel: Nearby Photo Spots\r\n    Travel: Time Back Home\r\n    Translation\r\n    Weather\r\n\r\nReception\r\n\r\nScott Webster of CNET praised Google Now for its ability to remind users of events based on past location histories and check-ins and further commended it for providing \"information instantly in a clean, intuitive manner\" without the user requesting it.[14] Critically, a review by Ryan Paul of Ars Technica claims that like most other voice activated apps, including Siri, voice recognition is a major issue. However, Paul noted that the ability to type queries provides users with more options.[15] Some commentators have noted that the predictive power of Google Now reveals \"exactly how much data and information Google actually has about [users'] routines and daily lives.\"[16]\r\nSee also\r\n\r\n    Ask Ziggy - for Windows Phone\r\n    EasilyDo – a smart phone assistant\r\n    S Voice – used by the Samsung Galaxy range\r\n    Tellme Networks, subsidiary of Microsoft that builds telephone-based apps\r\n    Voice Mate – used by the LG Optimus, G, and Vu ranges\r\n    Siri – Personal Assistant available in Apple Inc's iOS Devices\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
